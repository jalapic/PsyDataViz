# Bump charts

Bump charts are useful for looking at how rankings of a set of observations change over time. They are named (I think) after the visualizations of changes in rankings of Oxford and Cambridge college rowing crews during boat races. Because the river wasn't wide enough to accommodate all the boats at once, they would start their races at different points on the river and their goal was to "bump" the boat in front. This would mean that they went up in ranking. This was visualized in charts like the one below. When lines cross, this means that the boats bumped and the boats switched rankings:

## Basic Bump Chart in ggplot()

We can look at how to make a bump chart using basic `ggplot2` syntax. We'll recreate the above chart. Let's import the data:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df <- read_csv("data_raw/torpids.csv")
head(df)
```

We have 12 rows of data. Each row is a college team. There are eight columns with the last seven being the ranking of each college on that day. To turn the data into a plottable format, we need to have a long data frame with columns `team`, `day` and `rank`.

```{r}
dfl <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=2:8, names_to = "day", values_to = "rank")
head(dfl)
```

We can now plot day against rank using a combination of `geom_line()` and `geom_plot()`. First we will create a plot color with a legend depicting each college. We use `scale_y_reverse()` to plot the rankings on the y-axis from highest rank at the top of the plot to lowest ranking at the bottom.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
ggplot(dfl, aes(x = day, y = rank, color = Team, group = Team)) +
  geom_line(lwd=1) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  xlab("")+
  scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:12) +
  theme_classic()
```

However, I think this plot is a little too colorful. Alternatively, we could create the plot in one color and add labels on the y-axis that have the names of the original ranks of teams. This would be more similar to the original plot:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
ggplot(dfl, aes(x = day, y = rank, group = Team)) +
  geom_line(lwd=1) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  xlab("")+
  scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:12, labels = df$Team) +
  theme_classic()
```

There are probably several stylistic changes we could make to this plot to make it more visually appealing. It's often nice with bump charts to have the dots be empty circles. We can do this by adding smaller white points on top of the points that we already plotted:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
ggplot(dfl, aes(x = day, y = rank, group = Team)) +
  geom_line(lwd=1) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  geom_point(color = "#FFFFFF", size = 2) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:12, labels = df$Team) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_classic() 
  
```

In this plot, I have used the `theme()` function to remove the y axis line and tick marks and to make the text larger.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
ggplot(dfl, aes(x = day, y = rank, group = Team)) +
  geom_line(lwd=1) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  geom_point(color = "#FFFFFF", size = 2) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:12, labels = df$Team) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(1.5))
        )

```

**Highlighting Individual Groups**

Another thing that is often beneficial in bump charts is to highlight individual groups of interest. This is particularly useful if there are lots of subjects. For example, let's say we are interested in the change in ranking of the Trinity boat over time. What we would like to do is make the other lines more transparent and to make Trinity's line bolder. To do this, we use `alpha()` to set the transparencies of the other crews and I also made their colors grayer. Then I create a dataframe that only includes Trinity's data to plot over the top of our plot, and change the color of their points and lines and thicken their line to emphasize it.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

Trinity <- dfl %>% filter(Team=="Trinity")

ggplot(dfl, aes(x = day, y = rank, group = Team)) +
  geom_line(lwd=1, color="gray50", alpha=.3) +
  geom_point(size=4, color="gray50", alpha=.3) +
  geom_line(data=Trinity, lwd=2, color="#710909") +
  geom_point(data=Trinity, size=4, color="#710909") +
  geom_point(color = "#FFFFFF", size = 2) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:12, labels = df$Team) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(1.5))
        )
```

## ggbump() package

I like the classic angular lines aesthetic of bump charts. However, there may be use cases where we wish to have curved lines joining points. This can be done effectively with the [ggbump package](https://github.com/davidsjoberg/ggbump).

The below code creates the generic plot for the college bumps dataset above. I've kept the `scale_y_reverse()` in the code so that we have the highest ranked team (i.e. 1) at the top of the y-axis, and the lowest ranked at the bottom. The `geom_bump()` function adds a curved line rather than straight line for each subject across time. The other difference is that I have made the `day` column numeric by using `as.numeric(factor(day))` rather than just `day`. Although `geom_bump()` should work with characters, I have found that converting them to numeric variables works best.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
library(ggbump)

ggplot(dfl, aes(as.numeric(factor(day)), rank, color = Team)) +
    geom_bump(size=1) +
    scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:12) 


```

Below I have customized this plot with some additional code. I have decided to create a palette of 12 colors using the `viridis` palette, though having 12 separate colors for a discrete category is probably pushing the limits of what is easily interpretable. These colors would be added in alphabetical order as a default as the `Team` variable is a character. This would mean that Balliol would have the darkest purple color and Wadham the lightest yellow. A better way of assigning color would be by initial or final rank. I decided to assign here by initial rank. Therefore I converted the `Team` variable to a factor and made the levels the order of ranks on the first day. The easiest way to do this was to use `unique(dfl$Team)` as they appear in rank order of the first day in the dataset.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(viridis) #for color scale

#refactor Team to be in rank order (same as order appears in dataset)
dfl$Team <- factor(dfl$Team, levels = unique(dfl$Team))

ggplot(dfl, aes(as.numeric(factor(day)), rank, color = Team)) +
  geom_bump(size=1) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  geom_point(color = "#FFFFFF", size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:7) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:12, labels = df$Team) +
  scale_color_manual(values=viridis(12,option="C")) +
  xlab("Day") +
  ylab("Rank") +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab("Day") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    axis.line.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(1.5)),
    legend.position = "none"
  )


```
