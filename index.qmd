# Preface {.unnumbered}

I am James Curley, Professor in the Psychology Department, UT Austin.

This guide to using `ggplot2` to make graphs is aimed primarily at Psychology students, but could be used by anyone interested in improving their data visualization skills.

I have adapted many different visualizations from many different authors. I have tried to acknowledge everyone as I have gone along.

The book is very much in progress - I am just adding bits and pieces as I go along. More will be added all the time.
